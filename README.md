# ds-devops-scripts
My personal scripts to automate setting up a new machine for data science/development. This is meant for users who frequently create new VMs or need to set up new dev machines.

`build_datasci.sh` configures git, installs development-related R for my work on [mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr), and installs Python from Anaconda

I will add more scripts here as I make them. Feel free to contribute if you have any useful workflows!
